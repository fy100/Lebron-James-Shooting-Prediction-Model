# Lebron-James-Shooting-Prediction-Model
Using Machine Learning Models Predicting Lebron James’ shooting throughout his career
The Primary Goal:
The purpose of this project is to research the model that predicts Lebron James’ shooting performance in his career.

Who is Lebron James?


This project discusses using machine machines to analyze the career statistics of LeBron James, a famous NBA basketball player. First, let me introduce this guy; he was born on December 30th 1984, in Akron, Ohio, United States. He is an American professional basketball player. He was 6’ 9″ tall and weighed 250 lbs. He plays with the Los Angeles Lakers with the head coach JJ Redick.

Moreover, he has had ten appearances in the NBA finals in his career. He has won the NBA championship titles with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013, the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016, and the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020. In 2023 for this year, he became one of the NBA all-time scoring leaders for all the NBA players, breaking the record for about 38387 points previously by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who is an American former basketball player. His dominance continues today, as he reached 40000 points in 2024. He has achieved some incredible milestones:

NBA Leading Scorer of All Time

4x NBA champion

4x NBA Finals MVP

4x NBA MVP

20x NBA All-Star

3x NBA All-Star Game MVP

6x NBA AI-Defensive Team

NBA Rookie of the Year

NBA Cup winner: 2023

NBA Cup Most Valuable Player: 2023

NBA Cup All-Tournament Team

3x Olympic Gold medalist

FlBA Men’s Olympics Most Valuable Player: 2024



Why we building this model?
Creating the prediction model for Lebron James shooting abilities is extremely important as it provides insights into one of the players in NBA history. By studying and forecasting his shooting performance, we can discover trends and elements that play a role in his success offering benefits to teams, coaches and analysts. Furthermore, this project has the potential to improve the player development techniques, game strategies and sports analytics giving an advantage through the use of data driven knowledge to enhance the performance and decision making during the games.
